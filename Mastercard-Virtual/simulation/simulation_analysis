The phishing simulation was designed to test how employees respond to suspicious emails. 

**Two drafts were created:**

**Initial Phishing Email** – poorly formatted, generic wording, and an untrustworthy sender address.

**Improved Phishing Email** – more professional, contextual, and believable to increase the likelihood of engagement.

The improved version aimed to replicate how real attackers craft convincing phishing messages.

**Email Drafts**

*Obvious Fake*
- Sender: mastercardsIT@gmail.com
- Generic greeting (“Dear User”)
- Poor grammar and formatting
- Suspicious link ([Wikipedia phishing page])
- Lacks confidentiality notice


*Improved Phishing Email*

- Sender: “Mastercard IT Department”
- Personalized greeting (“Dear [Employee Name]”)
- Clear structure with step-by-step instructions
- Professional tone, urgency (“reset within the next hour”)
- Added Confidentiality Notice to mimic real corporate emails
- Fake IT support email address (support-mastercards@gmail.com) for realism

**Lessons Learned**
- Professional appearance increases believability
- Employee awareness is critical
- Training should include examples of both “obvious” and “advanced” phishing attempts

*The phishing email drafts illustrate how attackers can escalate from basic to sophisticated tactics. While the “obvious fake” is easy to detect, the improved phishing email I created shows how easily employees could be deceived without proper training. This underscores the need for continuous and comprehensive security awareness programs.*
